### State of London Dashboard

Welcome to State of London Dashboard (BETA version). 

This Dashboard provides a selection of key datasets informing the work of the Mayor, the London Assembly, and stakeholders in London. The charts here mirror those included in the [State of London report](https://data.london.gov.uk/dataset/state-of-london), providing the latest available data.   

Topics covered in both the report and the Dashboard are: 

* [Demography](#demography)  
* [The Economy and Labour Market](#economy) 
* [Communities](#communities) 
* [Crime and Safety](#crime) 
* [The Environment](#environment)
* [Housing](#housing) 
* [Income, Poverty and Destitution](#poverty) 
* [Transport and Digital Infrastructure](#infrastructure) 
* [Young people and Education](#young-people) 
* [Health and Wellbeing](#health-wellbeing) 


The Dashboard is in development and we welcome feedback to: intelligence@london.gov.uk
